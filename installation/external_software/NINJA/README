Quick NINJA README pre-release clustering only ( 0.95-cluster_only ) 

Compilation:
    Tested only on linux using g++, with the "make all" command.

Arguments:

--in (or -i) filename 
    Specify file (fasta format) containing precomputed pairwise distances.
    (default is to read the filename from the first argument not associated
    with a -- flag, as shown above) 

--out (or -o) filename 
    Specify file to which the tree will be written (default = stdout)

--in_type type [a | d]
    Type of input, alignment or distance matrix
    'a' type causes NINJA to accept an alignment in fasta format
    'd' type causes NINJA to accept a (phylip format) file containing 
    precomputed pairwise distances.
    Default = a
    
--out_type type [c | d]   
    Type of output, tree or distance matrix
    'c' type calculates a Nearest-Neighbor clustering of the sequences,
        and writes a table including a cluster identifier to a file.
    'd' type just computes the distances and outputs them.
    Default = c           
         
--alph_type type [a | d]
    'a' if input consists of amino acid sequence
    'd' if input consists of dna sequence
    Default = amino. 
    
--corr_type type [n | j | k | s | m]
    Correction for multiple same-site substitutions.
    'n' no correction
    'j' jukes-cantor correction  { dist = -3/4 * ln (1 - 4/3 * dist ) }
    'k' kimura 2-parameter correction { dist = -1/2 * ln ( (1-2p-q)*sqrt(1-2q) ) }    
    's' FastTree's scoredist-like correction { dist = -1.3 * ln (1.0 - dist) }
    'm' Mothur's onegap correction -- only counts a string of gaps as a single
        gap. This includes end gaps but excludes alignment padding. 
        { dist = (mismatches + gap_inits) / (matches + mismatches + gap_inits) }
    Default: 'k' for DNA, 's' for amino acid

--cluster_cutoff dist_cutoff 
    The maximum distance between two sequences for inclusion in the same 
    cluster.  Only applicable to the clustering method ( --out_type c ).
    Default: 0.03

--rebuild_step_ratio (or -r)  
    See paper for details.  Default = 0.5.

Execution:

./NINJA [arguments]

Example:

./NINJA --out_type c -i e_coli_1000.fa -o out.txt
